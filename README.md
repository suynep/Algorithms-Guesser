# Algorithms Guesser

A tiny lil script to practice algorithms via Fill in the Blanks.
> *Don't stress, just practice.*

## To Run:
Execute the following commands in your terminal:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If the error/warning prompts you to use a `virtual environment`, simply do:

`python3 -m virtualenv .venv`

and

`source ./.venv/source/bin/activate`

and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` again.

**Lastly**,

`python3 main.py` & start!

## To add your own Algorithms/Pseudocode:
Simply Create a new `.txt` file in the algorithms folder with the `Algorithm_Name.txt` format. The script
will do the rest!

*Enjoy! Happy Practicing*
